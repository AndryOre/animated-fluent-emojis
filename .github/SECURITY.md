# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities **privately** using GitHub's built-in
Private Vulnerability Reporting:

**→
[Open a security advisory](https://github.com/AndryOre/animated-fluent-emojis/security/advisories/new)**

Do **not** open a public issue for security reports. That exposes the
vulnerability before a fix is available.

**Response times:**

| Severity | Acknowledge (target) | Patch target |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Critical | 48 h                 | 7 days       |
| High     | 5 days               | 14 days      |
| Medium   | 10 days              | 30 days      |

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version of `animated-fluent-emojis` on npm is
supported. There are no maintained release branches. A fix lands on `main` and
ships in the next release.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |
| older   | ❌        |

## Upgrade Path

Fixes are published to npm as a new version. Upgrade with your package manager
(for example `bun update animated-fluent-emojis`). There is no separate patch
channel.

## Security Design

For the trust boundaries, CSP requirements, supply chain and known limitations
of the library, see [`docs/security.md`](../docs/security.md).

## Credit

Reporters are credited by name (or handle) in the GitHub Security Advisory
unless you ask to stay anonymous when you report. Let us know your preference in
the initial report.
